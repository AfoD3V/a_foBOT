# a_foBOT

### **About Project**
My own implementation of the discord bot - this project is going to be developed slowly over the time.

<br>

### **Good to know**
Bot script have to be equipped with `config.ini` file which is going to store following details:
```ini
[discord]
token = discord_token

[id]
id = server_name # this is optional at the moment

[secret_phrase]
key = key_by_which_secret_menu_is_going_to_be_called
```

When typing in the Discord - we can hide our phrase with a use of spoiler tag `||text||`:

```
||key_phrase||
||key_phrade option mode||
```
